__Violet__ Sorrengail is forced by her mother, a high-ranking general in the kingdom of Navarre, to enroll in the dangerous and brutal training to become an elite dragon rider at __Basgiath War College__. There, she meets __Xaden__ whose father was executed by Violet's mother for leading a rebellion five years ago. Violet manages to survive training, especially the Gauntlet, and even makes friends among her squad (Rhiannon, Sawyer, Ridoc). At Threshing, she bonds with not one but two dragons -- __Tairn__, a large black dragon, and __Andarna__, a small golden adolescent dragon -- something that has never happened before. Tairn is mated with Xaden's dragon __Sgaeyl__, which creates a bond between Xaden and Violet. As Xaden helps to train and protect Violet - including adressing her a bodygard (Liam), they develop feelings for each other.

Eventually, Violet discovers her "signet power" (a power manifested from the bond between the dragon and rider) of wielding lightning. Just before graduation, Violet goes with Xaden and a small group he trusts to complete a mission at an outpost outside the kingdom's boundaries. Xaden reveals he and his friends - marked ones - have been delivering weapons to help protect __Poromiel__, their enemies. Navarre has been under attack by gryphon fliers from nearby Poromiel out of need for resources from Navarre to fight off "venin" -- people who have been corrupted by channeling dark magic. __Venin__ absorb the life force and magic from things around them and they are able to and conjure wyvern to fight off dragons. Navarrian authorities have led people to believe Poromiel is simply greedy and war hungry, and they deny the existence of venin.

Xaden figures out that Violet's childhood friend, __Dain__ Aetos, has secretly been using his power of seeing someone's recent memories, on Violet without her consent in order to glean information about Xaden's activities. Violet agrees to join Xaden's fight as they engage in a deadly battle when venin attack nearby. After __Liam__ dies saving her, Violet's lightning bolts are able to help kill the wyvern and the venin. When Violet recovers, she learns that her brother __Brennan__ (who she believed to have been killed during the rebellion) is alive and part of the revolutionaries.

# Iron Flame #2
_One generation to change the text. One generation chooses to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history._

In Part I, When Violet returns to Basgiath for her second year, all riders who were at Athebyne are being hunted. Because the revolutionary town of Aretia has a unpowered wardstone, Violet makes it her mission to learn how to power up a wardstone so they can put up a new ward against venin - the corrupted souls attacking outside Navarre's borders. Meanwhile, Xaden works on building a forge in Aretia capable of smelting daggers that can kill venin.

With the help of her squadmates and a cadet called Aaric (who is secretly King Tauri's son), Violet steals two journals from the royal vault written by the First Six (Lyra and Warrick) with the information about how the wards were built. However, in doing so, Violet's activities are revealed. Lyra's journal is taken. When Dain learns the truth, he helps Violet escape, along with Xaden and Garrick. Tairn shares the memory of the battle of Resson with all the dragons, to be passed along to their riders, to ask them to join the revolution. They then all flee to Aretia, along with a horde of other riders who have joined their cause.

In Part II, At Aretia, the cadets are organized to continue their training. By negotiating for a "luminary" (needed to heat dragonfire) with Viscount Tecarus, the forge is completed, and a group of gryphon rider cadets join them at Aretia. Violet also learns that Xaden's dragon previous bond to someone in Xaden's familial line (his grandfather) means Xaden has a secret second signet -- he's able to sense people's intentions. Meanwhile, Violet struggles to learn to control and aim her lightning strikes, and she gets the wards up based on instructions in Warrick's journal just before a major wyvern attack. However, a private meeting with Violet's mother, General Sorrengail, reveals that Warrick's instructions are flawed, and she secretly gives Violet Lyra's journal instead, saying that above all she wishes for her daughters to live.

Despite the hostilities with Navarre, when the venin launch a major attack on Basgiath, Violet and Xaden knows all of Navarre will fall if they don't come to their aid. It begins with the discovery that Jack has turned venin. Before they can stop him, he breaks the wardstone protecting all of Navarre. The battle is brutual, an attack of a thousand wyvern against an unwarded Basgiath with all its forces and the many gryphons rushing to defend it. As they battle, Brennan mends the wardstone. Jesinia determines that it requires seven types of dragons for the ward, and Violet realizes her dragon Andarna is not a black dragon but a seventh breed of dragon. Violet is about to burn out trying to imbue the wardstone with power, but her mother stops her and gives up her life and power for it instead. The ward is raised and the wyverns fall. But the book ends with Violet ominously noticing a red tinge around Xaden's eyes after the battle, indicative of someone who has turned venin.
